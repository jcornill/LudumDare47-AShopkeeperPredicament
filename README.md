## Game

 Did you ever stop to think what the NPCs in an MMO could be feeling like?
 What they could be thinking?
 Or how it could be to just…stand there? 

 Get stuck in the routine of a Shopkeeper NPC, and influence his decisions in his interactions.

 Watch out for those who watch you, and attempt to guide him towards a better fate…if you wish.
